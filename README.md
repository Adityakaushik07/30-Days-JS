    <summary>**Activity 1: Understanding Promises**</summary>
    
    - **Task 1:** Create a promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout and log the message to the console.
    - **Task 2:** Create a promise that rejects with an error message after a 2-second timeout and handle the error using `.catch()`.
  </details>

    <summary>**Activity 2: Chaining Promises**</summary>
    
    - **Task 3:** Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log messages in a specific order.
  </details>

    <summary>**Activity 3: Using Async/Await**</summary>
    
    - **Task 4:** Write an `async` function that waits for a promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value.
    - **Task 5:** Write an `async` function that handles a rejected promise using `try-catch` and logs the error message.
  </details>

    <summary>**Activity 4: Fetching Data from an API**</summary>
    
    - **Task 6:** Use the `fetch` API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promises.
    - **Task 7:** Use the `fetch` API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using `async/await`.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 5: Concurrent Promises**</summary>
    
    - **Task 8:** Use `Promise.all` to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log all their values.
    - **Task 9:** Use `Promise.race` to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.

  <summary>**Feature Request**</summary>
  
  1. **Promise Creation Script:** Write a script that demonstrates creating and handling promises, including both resolved and rejected states.
  2. **Promise Chaining Script:** Create a script that chains multiple promises and logs messages in a specific sequence.
  3. **Async/Await Script:** Write a script that uses `async/await` to handle promises and includes error handling with `try-catch`.
  4. **API Fetch Script:** Create a script that fetches data from a public API using both promises and `async/await`, and logs the response data.
  5. **Concurrent Promises Script:** Write a script that uses `Promise.all` and `Promise.race` to handle multiple promises concurrently and logs the results.

  <summary>**Achievement**</summary>
  
  By the end of these activities, students will:
  - Understand and create promises, including handling resolved and rejected states.
  - Chain multiple promises to perform sequential asynchronous operations.
  - Use `async/await` to handle asynchronous code more readably.
  - Fetch data from public APIs using both promises and `async/await`.
  - Manage multiple concurrent promises using `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.

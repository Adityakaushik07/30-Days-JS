# Day 1: Variables and Data Types

<details>
  <summary>**Tasks/Activities**</summary>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 1: Variable Declaration**</summary>
    
    - **Task 1:** Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.
    - **Task 2:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 2: Constant Declaration**</summary>
    
    - **Task 3:** Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 3: Data Types**</summary>
    
    - **Task 4:** Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 4: Reassigning Variables**</summary>
    
    - **Task 5:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 5: Understanding `const`**</summary>
    
    - **Task 6:** Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.
  </details>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Feature Request**</summary>
  
  1. **Variable Types Console Log:** Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.
  2. **Reassignment Demo:** Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>**Achievement**</summary>
  
  By the end of these activities, you will:
  - Know how to declare variables using `var`, `let`, and `const`.
  - Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
  - Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
  - Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.

  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 2: Assignment Operators**</summary>
    
    - **Task 6:** Use the `+=` operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
    - **Task 7:** Use the `-=` operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 3: Comparison Operators**</summary>
    
    - **Task 8:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>` and `<` and log the result to the console.
    - **Task 9:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `>=` and `<=` and log the result to the console.
    - **Task 10:** Write a program to compare two numbers using `==` and `===` and log the result to the console.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 4: Logical Operators**</summary>
    
    - **Task 11:** Write a program that uses the `&&` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
    - **Task 12:** Write a program that uses the `||` operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
    - **Task 13:** Write a program that uses the `!` operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
  </details>
  
  <details>
    <summary>**Activity 5: Ternary Operator**</summary>
    
    - **Task 14:** Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
  </details>
</details>
